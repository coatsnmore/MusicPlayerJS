# MusicPlayerJS

Plays song from JSON through the audioSynth objects using the Web Audio API.  Intended to be a sequencer of sorts.

Goals include the capability for playing multiple tracks at one time.  At some point would like to also a graphical editor for creating and sequencing tracks.


# Dependencies
The only dependency for this project is audioSynth.js from https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth
